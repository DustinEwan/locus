# The Locus Programming Language

**Status:** `[ Alpha / Functional Compiler ]`

**Vision:** A systems programming language that combines the expressive power of Rust's type system with a novel, intuitive memory safety model based on locality.

---

## What is Locus?

Locus is a new programming language born from a simple question: Can we have the compile-time memory safety and performance of Rust without the cognitive overhead of its lifetime system?

We believe the answer is yes. Locus provides:

* **A Rich Type System:** Full support for `structs` and `enums` with exhaustive `match` expressions for creating robust, domain-specific types.
* **Compile-Time Memory Safety:** Guarantees against dangling pointers, data races, and other common memory errors, enforced by the compiler before your code ever runs.
* **No Lifetimes:** The explicit lifetime annotations (`'a`) found in Rust are completely removed.
* **LLVM Backend:** Compiles to native machine code via LLVM IR for optimal performance.

Instead of lifetimes, Locus's safety model is built on **Locality and Uniqueness Modes**, an idea inspired by the research and extensions developed at Jane Street. This shifts the core question of memory safety from:

* **Time-based (Rust):** *"How long does this reference live?"*
* **Place-based (Locus):** *"Where in the code can this reference be used?"*

We believe this "spatial" or "place-based" mental model is more intuitive and leads to a more ergonomic developer experience without sacrificing safety.

### The Core Modes

The Locus compiler understands a set of "modes" that are orthogonal to a value's type. These modes describe the scope and access rules for any variable:

* **Locality Modes (`local` vs. `global`):** This is the lifetime replacement. A `local` reference is guaranteed by the compiler to never escape its defining scope (e.g., a function body), preventing dangling pointers. A `global` value can escape and is typically heap-allocated.
* **Uniqueness Modes (`unique` vs. `shared` vs. `exclusive`):** This is the ownership and borrowing model.
    * `unique`: Sole, owned access (like Rust's `String` or `Box<T>`).
    * `shared`: Multiple, read-only borrows (like `&T`).
    * `exclusive`: A single, mutable borrow (like `&mut T`).

## Current Features

Locus currently supports a comprehensive set of language features:

### âœ… Implemented Features
- **Complete Grammar**: ANTLR-based parser with full language support
- **Data Types**: Primitives (`i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`, `String`) and complex types
- **Structs & Enums**: Full support with generics and mode annotations
- **Functions**: Declaration, parameters, return types, and calls
- **Control Flow**: `if`/`else` statements, `while` loops, and nested control structures
- **Pattern Matching**: Comprehensive `match` expressions with literal, enum variant, and wildcard patterns
- **Expression-Oriented Programming**: Match expressions return values, implicit returns from functions
- **LLVM Backend**: Complete LLVM IR generation and native code compilation
- **Memory Safety**: Mode system implementation (locality and uniqueness modes)

### ðŸ”§ Example Programs
```locus
// Expression-oriented programming with match expressions
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }

fn get_color_value(color: Color) -> i32 {
    // Match expression returns value directly
    match color {
        Color::Red => 10,
        Color::Green => 20,
        Color::Blue => 30
    }
}

fn double_value(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x * 2  // Implicit return - no semicolon needed
}

fn main() -> i32 {
    // Match expressions can be used in variable assignments
    let result = match Color::Blue {
        Color::Red => 1,
        Color::Green => 2,
        Color::Blue => 3
    };
    
    // Functions with implicit returns
    let doubled = double_value(result);
    
    return doubled; // Returns 6
}
```

## Development Roadmap
