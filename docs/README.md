# Locus Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Locus programming language compiler implementation.

## Implementation Status Documents

### Core Features
- **[Pattern Matching Status](PATTERN_MATCHING_STATUS.md)** - Complete implementation of match expressions with all pattern types
- **[Control Flow Status](CONTROL_FLOW_STATUS.md)** - If/else statements and while loops with LLVM IR generation
- **[Struct/Enum Summary](STRUCT_ENUM_SUMMARY.md)** - Type system implementation with generics and mode annotations

### Compiler Infrastructure
- **[LLVM Status](LLVM_STATUS.md)** - LLVM IR generation, compilation pipeline, and native code output
- **[ANTLR Setup](ANTLR_SETUP.md)** - Parser generation, grammar development, and tooling setup

### Advanced Features
- **[Linked List Analysis](LINKED_LIST_ANALYSIS.md)** - Complex data structure implementation showcasing ownership model

## Quick Reference

### Current Implementation Status
